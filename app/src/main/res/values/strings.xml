    <string name="rocket_description">A rocket is a vehicle that propels itself through space or the Earth\'s atmosphere by expelling exhaust gases in the opposite direction, adhering to Newton\'s third law of motion. Rockets come in various types, including liquid, solid, hybrid, and ion rockets, each with its own characteristics and applications. They possess the capability to achieve escape velocity, allowing them to break free from Earth\'s gravitational pull and reach space. Rockets are used for diverse purposes, such as space exploration, satellite deployment, military applications, and interplanetary travel. They can carry payloads of different sizes and are vital tools for human spaceflight, scientific research, and national security. Challenges in rocketry include cost, safety, and environmental considerations, which continue to be addressed as technology advances in the field</string>
    <string name="mission_description">A space mission is a meticulously planned and executed expedition beyond Earth\'s atmosphere to achieve various scientific, exploratory, or technological objectives. These missions are conducted by space agencies and organizations worldwide and have contributed significantly to our understanding of the universe, Earth, and our place in the cosmos. Space missions encompass a wide range of endeavors, from launching satellites for communication and Earth observation to sending spacecraft to explore distant planets and celestial bodies. These missions often involve the deployment of cutting-edge technology, rigorous training of astronauts, and collaboration on an international scale, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and space exploration.</string>
